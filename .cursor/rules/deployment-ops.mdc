# Deployment and Operations Guidelines

## Vercel Deployment
- Use vercel.json for deployment configuration
- Configure proper API route rewrites
- Set up environment variables securely
- Use Vercel's serverless functions appropriately
- Monitor deployment logs and performance

## Database Management
- Use Alembic for database migrations
- Test migrations on development environment first
- Include both upgrade and downgrade operations
- Use proper migration naming conventions
- Document database schema changes

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate development, staging, and production configs
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use .env files for local development
- Validate required environment variables at startup

## Dependencies Management
- Keep requirements.txt up to date
- Pin specific versions for production stability
- Regularly update dependencies for security
- Use virtual environments for development
- Document any special dependency requirements

## Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Use structured logging for better analysis
- Monitor API performance and error rates
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Log all external service interactions

## Error Handling
- Implement graceful error handling
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages to clients
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Performance Optimization
- Use database connection pooling
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries
- Use async operations for I/O-bound tasks
- Monitor and optimize memory usage

## Security in Production
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all input data
- Use secure headers
- Regular security audits and updates
